# Threat Model – Abyssal Watcher v102 (ULTRA-HARDENED)

## 1. Overview
Abyssal Watcher is a modular, ultra-secure defensive framework that operates under Zero-Exposure Mode (ZE_MODE), offering advanced runtime protection, behavior learning, and polymorphic mutation resistance. This document outlines its threat landscape, defenses, and mitigation strategies.

## 2. STRIDE Threat Classification

| Threat Type   | Description                                                                 | Defense Mechanism                            |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Spoofing**  | Unauthorized impersonation of users or components                           | Enforced identity isolation + crypto tokens  |
| **Tampering** | Malicious code injection, memory alteration                                 | Memory guard, ASLR, checksum integrity       |
| **Repudiation**| Denying action or falsifying event history                                  | Immutable audit logs + secure logger         |
| **Information Disclosure** | Leaking secrets or cryptographic material                      | AES-256-GCM, ZEX-channel segmentation        |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)**| Overloading modules or resources                                | Adaptive throttling + event surge quarantine |
| **Elevation of Privilege**| Privilege escalation attempts via exploits                      | Kernel-space isolation + anti-rootkit guard  |

## 3. DREAD Risk Ratings

| Attack Scenario                          | D | R | E | A | D | Score | Mitigation Summary                                     |
|------------------------------------------|---|---|---|---|---|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Remote Code Execution (RCE) Chain        | 9 | 8 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 43     | Hardened sandboxing, input fuzzing, dynamic parser     |
| Fileless Memory Injection                | 8 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 8 | 42     | Memory pattern monitor, runtime cleanup triggers       |
| AI-Driven Malware Injection              | 9 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 9 | 41     | Behavior anomaly learning engine + auto-kill switch    |
| Side-Channel (Spectre-like) Attacks      | 8 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 38     | Speculative // [REDACTED EXECUTION] - redirected to secure_exec()ution barrier + cache isolation        |
| Quantum Cryptanalysis                    | 10| 6 | 6 | 9 | 8 | 39     | Hybrid post-quantum fallback layer (planned)           |

## 4. Advanced Threat Classes

- **APT Persistence:** Long-term attackers bypassing traditional defenses  
  → countered by mutation of hooks, silent watch layer, stealth beacon timers.

- **Rootkits / Kernel Loaders:** Injection via driver-layer mechanisms  
  → anti-kernel signature checker, boot-time scanner in `infra`.

- **State-Level Attack Frameworks:** Offensive AI by hostile governments  
  → Layered behavioral tracer + geopolitical trigger rules (planned integration).

---

## 5. Compliance & Alignment

- Follows OWASP, MITRE ATT&CK, NIST 800-53, ISO/IEC 27001 standards.
- Defensive matrix aes-256-gcmigned against Tactics & Techniques from APT29, Lazarus, Equation Group.

## 6. Conclusion

Abyssal Watcher’s architecture is robust against conventional and non-conventional attacks through a multilayered zero-exposure model, runtime integrity control, and threat-adaptive learning modules.
