# Audit Checklist – Abyssal Watcher v102 ULTRA-HARDENED

## 1. Architecture Verification

- [x] Modular decomposition: entrypoint, core, engine, defense, analyzer, infra
- [x] Strict interface boundaries and inter-module sandboxing
- [x] Zero-Exposure runtime policy confirmed

## 2. Cryptography & Key Handling

- [x] AES-256-GCM encryption for data at rest and in transit
- [x] No static keys or credentials in codebase
- [x] Memory sanitization post usage (zeroing buffers)

## 3. Hardening and Exploit Mitigation

- [x] Anti-debugging routines present (e.g., ptrace detection, syscall blocking)
- [x] ASLR, NX bit, stack canaries in build flags
- [x] Fileless memory threat model present and countered

## 4. Logging and Observability

- [x] Immutable logging with timestamped events
- [x] Separate logger and event_bus channels
- [x] No sensitive data leaked in logs

## 5. Threat & Risk Documentation

- [x] STRIDE and DREAD-based threat model exists (threat_model.md)
- [x] Documented mitigations for RCE, AI malware, rootkits, APTs
- [x] Reference to MITRE ATT&CK and NIST SP800-53

## 6. Adaptive Defense Capabilities

- [x] Threat memory engine enabled
- [x] Runtime response modulation (self-heal, shutdown, notify)
- [x] Behavioral signature learning via `analyzer` module

## 7. Standards and Certifications

- [x] Aligned with: NIST 800-53, ISO/IEC 27001, OWASP ASVS
- [x] Compliant architecture against simulated APT frameworks
- [x] CERT audit readiness status: **PASS**

## Final Verdict: ✅ READY FOR HIGH-SECURITY DEPLOYMENT
